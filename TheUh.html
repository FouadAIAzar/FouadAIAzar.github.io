                    At the start of another morning of lockdown, and a sisyphean crawl to the overpowered PC, I sat with my bass and jammed to another backing track. <i>Funk Drum Loop 62 BPM</i> by <i>Golden Drums</i> was the algorithm lottery winner of that day.

                    The practice session commenced, without much thought of what the goal was. Strings of noddles of lines up and down the diatonic E; no 2nd or 6th in sight, and those sevenths and thirds feeling kinda flat, I was surly playing an E minor pentatonic, to no one's suprise. A stream of conciousness letting loose into the void of space, creating noise with no scape, whose goals seemed futile as an unconcentrated soul wandered off.

                    Such a simple melody with an even simpler call and response. But it wasn't the melody that rung the bells of dopamine, no -- that honor belongs to the lyrics, which went a little something bit like this:

                    An absurdist parody turned into reality the core idea of <i>The Uh in Funk</i> was born. Like Archimedes out of the tub, I ran naked and unapologetically through my mind and attempted quickly produced a one-minute song and video to upload to social media. A DAW was whipped open, weblinks were called to extract audio, and basslines and lyrics were further written without reverence. The song had no point, it had no meaning, it had no basis -- it was absurd and I loved it.
                </p>

                    The production was completed and uploaded the same day. Although it was the kind of job more befitting for a streetwalker -- quick and dirty, and that quality is reflected in the video, nevertheless it was something I loved. I went to bed that night with a level of satisfaction that was envied even by sated hedonists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project sat undone and marked off as another silly output of an otherwise overly active brain. I continued working on other smaller projects -- namely bass solos, and I kept putting out small low quality videos onto social media, all the while <i>The Uh in Funk</i> was cooking up something in the back of my head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the time, I wasn't the only musician with a project up his sleeve. <a href="https://ferasarrabi.com/home/" target="_blank">Feras Arrabi</a> approached me and we began working a good year and a half on his debut album, during which time I was learned about the efforts of producing an album. I was very proud about all the ideas we were able to incooperate into this project, all of which came in very handy when the thought of that song came up again.
                </p>
                <div class="center iframeVideo">

                <p>
                    My routine at this point felt very kafkaesque. I woke up, dragged my half-living body to the computer, typed away at some text or code for my work and then finally indulged in some abstract project. It is for this reason, that it is no wonder, that I would clearly have some form if not many thoughts occuring on the thematic and titular topic<span class="aesthetic">:existentialis</span>m.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And although I can imagine myself indulging in the volitile nihilism of Nietzsche or the anxious absurdism of Kierkegaard, I was a fan of Absurdist who took a light-heart approach to the matter. The absurdist writers like Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett always resonated with me more than the futile stories of Kafka and Hesse. Their style of writing garnered the attention of my whole soul and placed it in an auditorium to with freshly washed eyes and ears. It was this type of absurdism that my mind understood well.

                </center>
                <p>
                    This idea inturiged me to the point I wanted to establish for myself the musical equivalent of absurdity... but this was proving to be difficult.
                    I wanted to avoid making it an odd rhythm or melody. I wanted it to almost act like a function. Functional harmony, that is.

                    Cardiacs. It was the cadiac's cadence that finally solved the puzzle. I wish I could describe to you the mathematical formulas that I'd written on the board and that I Q.E.D.ed it with <i>Reductio ad absurdum!</i>

                    The reality is, I found my sound through an old and tried-and-true method of research (aka. googling), which led me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiacs">Cardiacs</a>. If you haven't listened to them before, you'll find their music feeling kinda weird. I mean, it has all the components of punk rock elements, mixed with the audio quality of some black metal band and the experimentation with everything on-par with contemporary composers and proggers at the time. But more importantly, they had a consistent sound. I could never quite understand what was so consistent about their sound until I stumbled on to Tentacrul's (not to be confused with the pokemon Tentacruel) video summary of Cardiacs.

                <p>
                    In this diatribe, to which I subscribe, the Cardiacs used a specific chord progression that had an insistence that the root -- our home chord, was never as it seemed. Whatever meaning we thought we had, whatever etablsihed rule there was, found itself voided, but only by consequence of our belief that there is any meaning to this rule. More importantly, I find that this rule-break, this escape from meaning, not only escapes our reality, but also elevates us to one that we hadn't even considered before.

                        I found meaning in this chord progression. I felt absurdism.

                With that, I will fianlly conclude the awfully long preface. The next four sections will cover the lyrical and musical context of the 4 movements in <i>The Uh in Funk.</i>

        <section class="main-section" id="Elitism">
            <header>Elitism</header>
            <blockquote>
                "<i>Anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.'</i>"
                <cite>-- Issac Asimov</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                My intention is not to illustrate a point about <i>intellectualism</i>, but rather to establish the concept of the Royal Us vs inferior them. Here Issac declares a class, a subset within a populus, which can be inferred as the "intellctuals," and a second, inferior class  refered to as the "anti-intellectuals."  
            </p>
            <p>
                The elitist is a special breed of human. They are born with a natural sense of superiority that sets them apart from the rest of humanity. They are often wealthy, and always better educated than the average person. They believe that their status gives them the right to look down on others and to treat them with contempt.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only thing that doesn't seem to bother the eltist is the fact that their eltist status is subjective, and derived from a scale that can only measure what they deem legitamate. In fact, some might say it is a form of <i>legitamate</i> discrimination. I believe that elitism in its purest form has intentions of doing good, but what good looks like can differ from subject to subject. In fact, it is the permutation of a simple idea that is held between peers that eventually mutates to elitism. This is the concept of the first section - Elitism.
            <p>
                It starts, with the silly lyrics:
            </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <center>
                        <i>
                            Picture this...<br>
                            You're walking down the street,<br>
                            You see a fine lady "How you doin' today?"<br>
                            She says "I'm doing quite fine do you know the uh?"<br>
                        </i>
                    </center>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    I had two goals with the lyrics.
                    <ul>
                        <li>To subvert the listeners expectation by keeping it silly;</li>
                        <li>To use the silliness to drive the point of the void meaning The Uh.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Truly, there is nothing you should find profound in this first section, but the characters in this play think otherwise.

                The main talking points:
                <ul>
                    <li>The first section is choatic; harmony is non-functional; time signature is odd with 5/8 adding more imbalance</li>
                    <li>The second section is more triumphant, sounding like it's leading to a victory, but still it's skewed. This is represented with the hypermeter of 15+19+15+20/16 time signature. This section also establishes the polyrythm 5:3</li>
                    <li>The prog noodle enters a stabler rhythm on 15/16, but is still threading through some rought terrain until fianlly</li>
                    <li>Victory! A huge brass section celebrates victory with a stable 5:3</li>
                    <li>However, that celebration doens't last long as we reach the last unsatisfying chord.</li>
